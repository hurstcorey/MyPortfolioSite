# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases your skills, projects, and achievements in an elegant and responsive design.

I used a tutorial created by [webdecoded](https://www.youtube.com/@webdecoded) to learn the basics of this site.
If you use the tutorial please make sure you pay the kindness forward. [Buy webdecoded5 a coffee](buymeacoff.ee/webdecoded5)
